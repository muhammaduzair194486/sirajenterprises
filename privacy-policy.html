            <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>The information of our clients is secure, as it is protected during transmission by the use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Software which encrypts the information the client puts in.</p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

            <h3>Access of Registered Accounts</h3>
            <p>The client can access their registered accounts by signing in on our homepage.

The users are able to update their information once they have logged in to their accounts by clicking My Account.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="margin-bottom-20">
            <h3>Changing &amp; Deleting/Unsubscribing Accounts</h3>

          <div class="margin-bottom-20">
            <h3>Cookies and Their Use</h3>
            <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to the clients' hard drives through their Web browsers. This enables our systems to recognize the clients' browsers and storage of items in their Shopping Carts during visits.</p>
            <p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will be more helpful in explaining how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the user when a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the top features at our site, and our company's personal recommendation is that the client leaves them to be accepted.</p>

Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet service provider.

            <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
